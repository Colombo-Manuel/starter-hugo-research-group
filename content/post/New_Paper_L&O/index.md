Our new paper [“Control of particulate manganese (Mn) cycling in halocline Arctic Ocean waters by putative Mn‐oxidizing bacterial dynamics”]( https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.12407) has been published. This large-scale field study combines trace element analysis with microbial data to unravel the geochemistry of Mn in the Canadian Arctic Ocean.

Through a cross disciplinary collaboration, we present the first holistic study of the biogeochemical cycling of particulate manganese (pMn), an essential micronutrient and reactive element, in the Canadian Arctic Ocean (CAO). By integrating pMn data with microbial community compositional data, we investigate the role of putative Mn-oxidizing bacteria in driving authigenic Mn precipitation in the CAO, especially in subsurface halocline waters. Additionally, our findings reveal the importance of low light intensity (reducing photoinhibition) and elevated dissolved Mn concentrations as the main environmental factors explaining the relatively large abundance Mn oxidizing bacteria found in water masses where pMn peaked.
