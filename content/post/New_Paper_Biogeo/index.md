The new paper, lead by collaborator [Birgit Rogalla](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~brogalla/), [“Continental and Glacial Runoff Fingerprints in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Inuit Nunangat Ocean”](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JG007072) has been published. This study aims to provide a linkage between the terrestrial and marine environments, assessing the influence of freshwater inputs on biogeochemical cycles in the Canadian Arctic Ocean.

Rising temperatures and an acceleration of the hydrological cycle due to climate change are increasing river discharge, causing permafrost thaw, glacial melt, and a shift to a groundwater‐dominated system in the Arctic. These changes are funnelled to coastal regions of the Arctic Ocean where the implications for the distributions of nutrients and biogeochemical constituents are unclear. In this study, we investigate the impact of terrestrial runoff on marine biogeochemistry in Inuit Nunangat (the Canadian Arctic Archipelago) — a key pathway for transport and modification of waters from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic — using sensitivity experiments from 2002‐2020 with an ocean model of manganese (Mn).
