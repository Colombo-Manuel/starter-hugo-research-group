       I am always enthusiastic about working with creative, interdisciplinary and self‑motivated students and postdoctoral fellows who are passionate about geoscience and nature at large. Given the diverse research topics studied in the B.A.B. Lab, there is always room for interesting collaborations! Having a diverse, inclusive and welcoming Lab is something I strive for, and hence, I encourage underrepresented students and postdocs within Geosciences from the USA and abroad to contact me. I, as a Latino scientist who has been studying and working abroad for more than ten years, know that pursuing graduate studies and doing research in top tier institutions in the USA can be challenging (e.g., financially, sociocultural, etc.), so I will do my utmost to facilitate this important step in your academic career. If you are a motivated student / researcher with a strong science background, please do [contact me]({{< ref "contact" >}}) to explore potential collaborations! _Please, include your CV and a brief description of your interests and their relationship with the [research]({{< ref "research" >}}) done at the B.A.B Lab_.
       {style="color: black"}   
       
       When funding is available, I will be actively recruiting MSc and Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers ([Current Opportunities]({{< ref "opportunities#curropp" >}})), however, I strongly encourage those students and postdoctoral researcher who want to apply for external fellowships to discuss with me potential projects in advance. [See below]({{< ref "opportunities#info" >}}) for information about fellowships.

       ## [1] Iron and manganese oxide nature and bound-OC abundances in the Amazon Shelf: the effect of reductive dissolution and oxidative processes on OC stability
       {style="color: darkblue"}
       Mineral protection (e.g., clays) of organic carbon (OC) has been widely recognize as a significant factor controlling its stabilization, and thus, OC degradation rate and burial efficiency. Recent studies have been focusing on the OC “protective” effect of iron, and to a lesser extent manganese, minerals on OC stability. In this project, we will be investigating how the complex redox chemistry of Fe and Mn oxides influence OC cycling in the Amazon River/Shelf system, the largest river basin on Earth.   
       <br>

       __The B.A.B. Lab is seeking a student interested in pursuing a M.Sc. or Ph.D. in Marine Science at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) and William & Mary, starting in 2024/2025.__ The successful candidate will work primarily in the "Amazon" research project, studying how iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides influence organic carbon (OC) preservation in the Amazon River and adjacent shelf environment. This work will include the analysis of trace element speciation and Mn and Fe-bounded OC in multiple sediment cores, suspended sediments and porewater samples collected from the low Amazon basin to the Suriname continental shelf following the northward spreading of Amazon mudbanks along the shelf. The prospective student will be working in the brand new B.A.B. Lab facility [LINK], integrating innovative sample processing and analytical strategies for both TEs and OC as well as other biomarkers. This project is framed within the larger MUDBENCS Amazon Project lead by [Brad Rosenheim (University of South Florida)](https://www.usf.edu/marine-science/faculty/faculty-directory/geological-oceanography/brad-rosenheim.aspx) and [Valier Galy (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution)](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/vgaly/), with whom we will be closely collaborating.

       __The position is funded for a minimum of 2.5 / 5 years (M.Sc. / Ph.D.) including a 12-month stipend, tuition waiver and health insurance.__


       ### Qualifications: 
       {style="color: darkblue"}
       {{< hl >}}_The student should be highly self-motivated, curious, detail-oriented and have excellent writing and verbal communication skills, as well as the ability to work independently and collaboratively._{{< /hl >}}

       __The position requires a bachelor’s or master’s degree in oceanography, chemistry, biology, environmental science, engineering, or a related field.__ Given the strong laboratory component of the project, having experience working in a lab environment and processing samples (e.g., sediments, water, suspended matter, biological tissues, etc.) is beneficial.  Programming skills (e.g., __Python__, R, MATLAB) and some knowledge of analytical chemistry are desirable, but most importantly being eager to learn.  


       ### Application:
       {style="color: darkblue"}
       If interested, please [contact me]({{< ref "contact" >}}) as soon as possible to go over the M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs at VIMS and W&M, the timeline and the research topic. Please include in your email (_subject line “Prospective student”_) your CV, unofficial transcripts, and a cover letter stating your research interests and how those align with the "__Amazon River project__" specifically, and the lab at large. 
       For information about the School of Marine Science (SMS) graduate programs at VIMS and W&M, application materials and deadlines, please take a look to the following pages: [SMS](https://www.vims.edu/education/graduate/index.php), [SMS: Academic & General Policies](https://catalog.wm.edu/content.php?catoid=27&navoid=4248) and this [Link](https://www.vims.edu/education/graduate/admissions/index_off-season.php)
