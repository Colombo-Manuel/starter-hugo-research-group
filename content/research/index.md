      title: __Overview__
      subtitle: 
      text: |
       The functioning of ocean ecosystems, and the Earth system at large, relies upon the complex biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic and inorganic chemical species (e.g., phosphate, Fe, organic carbon), solids (e.g., plankton biomass, atmospheric dust, clay minerals) and colloids (e.g., polymetallic oxides, humic substances) in ocean waters and at the land ocean interfaces. For instance, trace elements (__TEs__), despite their low concentration in seawater, are key micronutrients (e.g., Fe, Mn, Zn) for aquatic primary producers, playing a key role in coastal and oceanic productivity and the carbon cycle. Likewise, organic carbon (__OC__) is an essential building block biomolecule and energy source for life on Earth, while in its oxidized state (carbon dioxide) it has profound implications for the global climate. Moreover, the study of OC and TEs (e.g. Pb, Al, Ga) lends important information of various biogeochemical processes in coastal and ocean waters, aiding to understand circulation patterns, internal cycling, anthropogenic impacts, etc.

        Given their importance, in ‚Äú_**B**iogeochemistry **A**cross **B**oundaries_‚Äù (__B.A.B.__) Lab we aim to study the processes influencing the cycling of OC, nitrogen, lipid biomarkers and TEs in rivers, estuaries and marine environments, focusing on their interconnectedness. We do so by working _across_ disciplinary (i.e., from TEs to OC geochemistry) and spatial (i.e., from land to ocean) _boundaries_, and integrating multiple environmental matrices (e.g., dissolved and particulate phases, sediments). The processes modulating the biogeochemistry of OC and TEs are deeply interlinked, from their sources and sinks (e.g., river outflow, primary production, remineralization of sinking particles, sediment resuspension, anthropogenic inputs) to the internal cycling controlling their distributions. However, the extent and significance of these processes vary along the land to ocean continuum, imposing challenges that have to be addressed with a cross disciplinary approach.

        The research developed at B.A.B. Lab has a strong cross disciplinary focus, combining knowledge and techniques from trace elements (__TEs__) and organic carbon (__OC__) geochemistry, and a process-oriented approach.

        ### Iron and manganese oxide nature and bound-OC abundances in the Amazon Shelf: the effect of reductive dissolution and oxidative processes on OC stability
         {style="color: darkblue"}
        Mineral protection (e.g., clays) of organic carbon (OC) has been widely recognized as a significant factor controlling its stabilization, and thus, OC degradation rate and burial efficiency. Recent studies have been focusing on the OC ‚Äúprotective‚Äù effect of iron, and to a lesser extent manganese, minerals on OC stability. In this project, we will be investigating how the complex redox chemistry of Fe and Mn oxides influence OC cycling in the Amazon River/Shelf system, the largest river basin on Earth.

        ### The geochemistry of Gallium in the Canadian Arctic Ocean: its role as Pacific-derived water tracer into the North Atlantic
         {style="color: darkblue"}
        Dissolved Gallium (dGa) have been recently recognized as a complementary tracer of pacific derived Arctic waters given the large differences in its concentrations between Pacific and Atlantic waters, besides providing complimentary information about oceanic processes. In this study, we are unraveling the cycling of dGa in the Canadian Arctic Ocean, and tracing the Arctic outflow into the Labrador Sea.

        ### Carbon cycling along river-ocean endmembers: A case study of the Rio de La Plata Estuary, Argentina
         {style="color: darkblue"}
        Large river systems along with continental margins are a central component of the Earth‚Äôs carbon cycle; they spatially integrate multiple carbon reservoirs (terrestrial, atmospheric and marine environments) and temporally link shorter timescale biological processes (e.g. primary production, remineralization) with larger timescale geological processes. In this project, we are studying the source to sink characterization of OC in the Rio de La Plata Estuary, the second largest South American river. The findings will be integrated with the better-studied Amazon River, thus expanding the South American perspective of global carbon cycling from the two largest rivers on this continent.
